**Systems Engineering Analysis COVID-19 Global Forecasting Kaggle Competition**
This prediction system focuses on using official data provided by the competition (train.csv, test.csv, and submission.csv) to train models, generate predictions, and produce valid submissions in the required format.

The system includes data preprocessing, model building, and prediction generation.
External factors such as social and political dynamics, optional additional databases, and the Kaggle infrastructure, which acts solely as a validator and feedback provider, remain outside the system.

The system boundary ensures that all internal operations are focused on transforming official data into useful and comparable predictions within the competition.
